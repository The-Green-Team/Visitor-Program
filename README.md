# Visitor Program

This program lets visitors sign in to your office or school and prints out a nametag for them (if there is a printer connected) and adds them to a server database (if you have specified a server in the configuration file).

Work in Progress:

* UI

* Server Side Database

* Login and Sign Up Pages

As of right now nothing works, any help is appreciated though



##Windows version will be made first then the Linux version will be built off of it.
